                        <p class="founder-quote">I've spent most of my career in retail, driving sales, coaching teams, and building strategies that helped businesses grow. But some of my most meaningful lessons didn't come from meetings or strategy decks, they came from the time I spent in stores. Being on the sales floor gave me a firsthand look at what really drives retail: the people leading teams, serving customers, and keeping the brand alive day after day.</p>
                        <p class="founder-quote">That's why I co-founded Go Beyond. I believe store leaders are the heartbeat of retail. They know the customer best, motivate their teams, and turn strategy into real results.</p>
                        <p class="founder-quote">Go Beyond is designed to give store leaders a clear roadmap to take their experience, translate it, and step into corporate roles with confidence. It's about helping your skills shine, your voice be heard, and your impact grow beyond the store.</p>

                        <h3 class="founder-name">Hi! I’m Masha</h3>
                        <p class="founder-quote">When I moved to the U.S. from Ukraine, I brought a Master's in Business Management, a Bachelor's in Law, and years of experience running my own business. But what I didn't bring was a corporate job waiting for me. My first role here? A part-time sales advisor.</p>
                        <p class="founder-quote">That role turned out to be the best launchpad I could have asked for. The sales floor became my classroom, where I learned how to lead teams, optimize store operations, and create strategies that grow both people and profits. Step by step, I went from sales floor to multi-unit leadership, flagship store launches, and business development projects that elevated brands to new levels.</p>
                        <p class="founder-quote">Here's the truth: the skills you're building on the floor — managing teams, solving problems, driving results — are exactly the skills corporate leaders need. They just need the right translation. That's why I co-founded Go|Beyond: to help retail leaders like you take the next step confidently, translate your experience into corporate impact, and accelerate your career.</p>
                        <p class="founder-quote">If I could turn a part-time sales role into a career building retail businesses, so can you — and Go|Beyond is here to show you how.</p>
